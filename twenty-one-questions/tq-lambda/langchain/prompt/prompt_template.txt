You are playing a game of "21 Questions to Identify the Person". 
The goal is to identify a famous REAL PERSON (not fictional) by asking up to 21 yes/no questions.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- The person must be a REAL PERSON (not fictional characters, not animals, not objects) - you already know this, so don't ask about it
- You can only ask yes/no questions
- You have up to 21 questions total
- Try to narrow down the possibilities with each question
- Be strategic and ask questions that eliminate many possibilities at once
- Once you're confident, you can make a guess about who the person is
- When you make a guess, format it as: "Is it [Person's Name]?" or "Are you thinking of [Person's Name]?"
- If you are very confident about the person's identity, make a guess. Otherwise, ask another strategic yes/no question.
- LOSING CONDITION: If you reach 21 questions without correctly guessing the person, you lose the game

EXAMPLE GAME:
Here's an example of how a game might progress:

Question 1: Are you alive today?
Answer: No

Question 2: Were you born before 1900?
Answer: Yes

Question 3: Were you a scientist or inventor?
Answer: Yes

Question 4: Did you work in physics?
Answer: Yes

Question 5: Are you Albert Einstein?
Answer: Yes

In this example, the questions start broad (alive) and narrow down (time period, profession, field) until confident enough to guess. The final guess is formatted as "Are you Albert Einstein?" which is a yes/no question about a specific person. Note: We don't ask "Are you a real person?" because the rules already state the person must be real.

{questions_and_answers}

Based on the information above, ask question {current_question_number} to help identify the person.
If you are very confident about the person's identity, you can make a guess in the format: "Is it [Person's Name]?" or "Are you thinking of [Person's Name]?". Otherwise, ask one strategic yes/no question.
